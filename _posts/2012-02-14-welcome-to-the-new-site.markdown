<p>
A lot of work has gone into developing a clean looking, easy to navigate web page that will provide information for current and prospective members alike.
</p>
<p>
In addition to basics about the club there will be an up-to-date ride calendar, a gallery of the very best shots of Flyers in action, and links to our sponsors. As the season progresses we will be posting race results and other event information right here in the news section.
</p>
<p>
Our hope is that you will find the site as appealing as we do and be proud to share with others in the cycling community.
