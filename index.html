  <h2>Flyers Racing Team and Cycling Club</h2>
  <p>
    Since 2008, the Dark Horse Flyers racing team and club have been at the 
    front of competitive and development cycling in Ontario. Through the 
    participation of its members, we continue to push our limits in bike racing, 
    triathlon, and charity rides. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The club is intended for road, cyclocross, and mountain bikers, as well as 
    triathletes. It is open to people who are beginners (but who are active and 
    have a decent fitness level) as well as racers. We are an 
    <a href="http://www.ontariocycling.org/" target="_blank;">OCA</a> affiliated 
    club.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both men and women are welcome. Our group rides are organized based on 
    ability, ensuring that everyone has an enjoyable and safe time on the 
    road.</p>
