  <h2>Flyers Racing Team and Cycling Club</h2>
  <p>
    Since 2008, the Dark Horse Flyers racing team and club have been at the front of competitive and development cycling in Ontario. Through the participation of its members, we continue to push our limits in bike racing, triathlon, and charity rides.
  </p>
  <h3>How to Join</h3>
  <p>
    The club is intended for road or mountain bikers and triathletes and is open to people who are beginners (but have been spinning/running/swimming and so have a decent fitness level) and racers. We are an <a href="http://www.ontariocycling.org/">OCA</a> affiliated club.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both men and women are welcome.  Our group rides are organized based on ability, ensuring that everyone has an enjoyable and safe time on the road. Membership is paid directly to the Ontario Cycling Association, 15% discount on fit and testing services and parts at <a href="http://hellovelo.ca">the shop</a>. Discounted rates for special events and clinics, team kit, and always free race day support. Membership is $55 or a UCI licence or proof of payment with another OCA affiliated club. More questions? <a href="mailto:flyers@hellovelo.ca">Email us</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Riders must read and agree to our <a href="docs/RMPlan2009.pdf">Risk Management Plan</a>.
