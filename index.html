  <h2>Flyers Racing Team and Cycling Club</h2>
  <p>
    Since 2008, the Dark Horse Flyers racing team and club have been at the front of competitive and development cycling in Ontario. Through the participation of its members, we continue to push our limits in bike racing, triathlon, and charity rides. 
  </p>
  <h3>How to Join</h3>
  <p>
    The club is intended for road, cyclocross, and mountain bikers, as well as triathletes. It is open to people who are beginners (but who are active and have a decent fitness level) as well as racers. We are an <a href="http://www.ontariocycling.org/" target="_blank;">OCA</a> affiliated club.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both men and women are welcome. Our group rides are organized based on ability, ensuring that everyone has an enjoyable and safe time on the road. Membership is $65 for the season and includes insurance with the OCA. This coverage is mandatory to participate in any club ride or event. For those that race with a UCI licence membership is $25. Riders must read and agree to our Risk Management Plan.
  </p>
  <p>
    A portion of the membership fee is donated to <a href="http://www.trails.ca/" target="_blank;">Trails Youth Initiative</a>, which the Flyers have been supporting since 2009.
