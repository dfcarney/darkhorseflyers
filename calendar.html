  <h2>Rider Levels</h2>
  <p>
    Not sure where you stand with the rest of the group? Here are some notes on the levels of rider.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Absolute Beginner</strong> – first bike in a long-time, kind of nervous on the road, looking to build fitness slowly.</li>
    <li><strong>Beginner</strong> – Experienced but not as fast, you have good bike handling skills and are looking to improve significantly this season and may be targeting your first ever long charity ride. You are looking for a group that will help you build your strength and skills as a cyclist.  No rockets, no egos, just a great group of people who love to ride.</li>
    <li><strong>Intermediate</strong> – The middle level. From very experienced riders to those coming up, this group is for those with good fitness and who have already completed a few charity rides or triathlons.</li>
    <li><strong>Master</strong> – You are racing this year or are doing some longer charity rides (over 100 km) with an average speed above 30km/h including starts and stops. You want to be quick and comfortable. Faster than the beginner group but still safe and focused on developing fitness over the season. Should you feel the urge to go on a break from the group, we’ll let you go.</li>
    <li><strong>Elite</strong> - You have a UCI race licence, race in Master 2, Senior 2, Expert, or higher. You are dedicated to your training and know that safe riding will get you to the start line ready to race. Riders at lower levels may request to join this group; riders who do not race are not permitted.
  </ul>

  <h3>Please Read the Following</h3>
  <p>
    Cycling is inherently dangerous. Even on a closed course there exists the risk of injury and even death. Riders are responsible for riding within their limits as well as assisting others to make sure our rides and events are safe and enjoyable. Racing is even more dangerous and everyone who goes to the start line should be ready to crash, have their bike broken, and to be significantly injured. Not everyone will, but you should be prepared. Just because you haven’t yet or you participate in events that do not permit drafting (like triathlon) does not mean you should be complacent and forget about the risks. Always use good judgement and do not endanger others.

    The club does not recommend riding in non-sanctioned rides or with clubs and teams who are not affiliated with the Ontario Cycling Association. Participating in any of those events is like driving your car without insurance. While eating a sandwich. And drinking hot tea. With a cigarette in your mouth. And the windows down in a snow storm. While wearing flowered culottes. And high heeled shoes. Listening to Celine Dion (the horror!).

  Safe Riding. Thanks for turning the pedals with us.
