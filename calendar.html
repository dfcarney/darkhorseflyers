  <h2>Rider Levels</h2>
  <p>
    Not sure where you stand with the rest of the group? Here are some notes on the levels of rider. Note that there may be crossover between ability levels on rides.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Beginner</strong> – Comfortable on the bike but not necessarily as fast as some. Looking to improve significantly this season and may be targeting your first ever long charity ride. You are looking for a group that will help you build your strength and skills as a cyclist. No rockets, no egos, just a great group of people who love to ride. </li>
    <li><strong>Intermediate</strong> –  The middle level. From very experienced riders to those coming up, this group is for those with good fitness and who have already completed a few charity rides or triathlons. You are able to complete rides between 50km and 75km and can maintain a speed of at least 25 km/h.</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced/Racer</strong> – You are racing or are doing some longer competitive charity rides. You can sustain an average speed above 30km/h for extended periods and can complete rides in excess of 100km without difficulty. You train seriously and work on developing the skills that will contribute to good results.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Please Read the Following</h3>
  <p>
    Cycling is inherently dangerous. Even on a closed course there exists the risk of injury and even death. Riding in a group poses additional risks because you will be moving fast in close proximity to others.  Riders are responsible for riding within their limits as well as assisting others to make sure our rides and events are safe and enjoyable. Racing is even more dangerous and everyone who goes to the start line should be ready to crash, have their bike broken, and to be injured. Always exercise good judgment and do not endanger others. 
  </p>

    The club does not recommend participating in non-sanctioned rides or with clubs and teams who are not affiliated with the Ontario Cycling Association. OCA affiliated clubs like the Dark Horse Flyers are more likely to promote safety and good riding etiquette. Participating in a non-sanctioned event is like driving your car without insurance.
