    The team kit (<a href="/docs/Flyers_2012_jersey.pdf">jersey</a> and 
    <a href="/docs/Flyers_2012_shorts.pdf">shorts</a>) is here!
  </p>
  <p>
    Most people liked the Hincapie stuff so we’re staying with it this year and the updated design Angela did looks amazing. If you are new to the club or didn’t get a kit last year, visit the Hincapie website and check out the 
    <a href="http://www.hincapie.com/custom/collections/velocity/">Velocity jersey and shorts</a>. Their sizing charts are farily comprehensive. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We also have cycling caps, socks, and water bottles. The caps are made by 
    <a href="http://www.walzcaps.com/">Walz</a> and are a three panel, 
    one-size-fits-all design. Socks are 
    <a href="http://www.defeet.com/60305/Cycling-Socks.html">DeFeet</a>
    Aireators with a 3” cuff and come in S/M/L/XL. The water bottles are 21oz by 
    Specialized.

    <a href="mailto:flyerspayment@gmail.com">Send an email</a> with your full name, size, and quantity of each item you’d like. We have set up an account so that you can do an email Interac transfer to this address right from your banking website. Most major banks offer this service and it is very secure. Orders are performed in bulk, so while some items might be readily available, you may have to wait for others to arrive.
   <!-- If you’d like to transfer your membership fee at the same time that would be great, however we’ll still need to collect your waiver in person. Once we have everyone’s order and payment we can place the order with Hincapie and get a better idea of the turnaround time. We will try to keep a few extra kits on hand but it’s best to order what you want now, there’s no guarantee we’ll have what you need later. If there is demand we may look at another order later in the summer. We also are looking at ordering custom socks, caps, arm and leg warmers… more info on that to come.-->
