  <h2>2012 Team Kit</h2>
  <p>
    The team kit (<a href="/docs/Flyers_2012_jersey.pdf">jersey</a> and 
    <a href="/docs/Flyers_2012_shorts.pdf">shorts</a>) is here!
  </p>
  <p>
    Most people liked the Hincapie stuff so we’re staying with it this year and the updated design Angela did looks amazing. If you are new to the club or didn’t get a kit last year, visit the Hincapie website and check out the 
    <a href="http://www.hincapie.com/custom/collections/velocity/">Velocity jersey and shorts</a>. Their sizing charts are farily comprehensive. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Pricing will be as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Jersey $125</li>
      <li>Bib Shorts $150</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    <a href="mailto:flyerspayment@gmail.com">Send an email</a> with your full name, size and quantity of each item you’d like. We have set up an account so that you can do an email Interac transfer to this address right from your banking website. Most major banks offer this service and it is very secure. If you’d like to transfer your membership fee at the same time that would be great, however we’ll still need to collect your waiver in person. Once we have everyone’s order and payment we can place the order with Hincapie and get a better idea of the turnaround time. We will try to keep a few extra kits on hand but it’s best to order what you want now, there’s no guarantee we’ll have what you need later. If there is demand we may look at another order later in the summer. We also are looking at ordering custom socks, caps, arm and leg warmers… more info on that to come.
